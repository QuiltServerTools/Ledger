# Networking

Ledger supports numerous custom packets for interacting with supported client mods

## Versions

The information on this page is applicable for Ledger Networking version 3, which is the version in Ledger versions `1.3.0` and later

## Packet Types

The server will not respond to packets unless the player has the correct permissions, which is `ledger.networking` and the relevant command permission

#### Notation
Types shown here are the Java variable types. They have the equivalent value (if applicable) in Kotlin when used in Ledger's internal code
